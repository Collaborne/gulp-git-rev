### Original path

Original file paths are stored at `file.revOrigPath`. This could come in handy for things like rewriting references to the assets.


### Asset hash

The hash of each rev'd file is stored at `file.revHash`. You can use this for customizing the file renaming, or for building different manifest formats.
